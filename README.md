## Overview

Looking at the Video and Livestream content creation sector it is of no doubt it's experiencing a rapid growth and with the promising market outlooks it's expected to keep on growing exponentially, Despite all these we believe Web3-based content creation platforms are yet to fully capitalize on this growth and realize a huge portion of the percentage, given how effectively Distributed Ledger technology solutions meet the primary needs of the content creation market.

In aim to bridge this open gap, we brainstorm on the development of not just another Web3 content creation platform but the one with the main goal of offering:

**Enhanced User Experience:** Delivering a seamless and engaging platform for creators and consumers, while addressing common Web3 DApp interaction challenges.

**Creators a sustainable revenue model** and also enables them the capability to efficiently maximize and fully realize earnings to be generated from their contents.

**Sovereignty for Creators** by granting them full control not only over the type of contents they create but also the type of users who can consume them.

Because we believe these are part of the main challenges yet to be fully resolved or overlooked by most currently available Web3 solutions. With all these to be achieved by leveraging Hedera's technology to build the next-generation content creation DApp.

## Features

**Sustainable Creator Economy:** By integrating our core smart contracts on the Hedera Network, we attained a frictionless payment experience in between content consumers and their favorite creators, creators in turn can easily claim their revenues generated from their contents. With all Blockchain interactions transparently recorded on the Hedera Explorer. Our platform token $HUB, built using the Hedera Token Service (HTS), can be used by users for tipping creators alongside $HBAR which is used for content gating fees and other platform functionalities.

**Diversified Content Creation for Creator:** On Hurbe, users can become any type of creator they desire depending on the wide range of content they choose to create, including gaming, educational materials, entertainment, and much more. To support these varying content types, we developed an underlying Midea Module API enabling creators to either livestream their content or upload videos seamlessly.

**Enhanced Social Engagement using Follower Tiers and Gated Content Access:** To initiate a more engaging social network for users and a way for consumers to support their favorite creators, we categorized content consumers into two types of group: "Followers" and "Super Followers”. With this we unlock creators the ability to manage which of these categorized users can view their contents and also create a revenue stream by setting up a gating fee to be paid in $HBAR for users to become a “super follower” and have access to contents a creator decide to be classed as exclusive on their channel on Hurbe.

**Content Creation based AI Assistant for Creators:** In order to make Content creation experience more enthralling for creators, We develop “Hurbe AI” an AI assistant which can be used to generate high quality images like thumbnails, cover photo and so on to be used for their contents.

## Forthcoming Functionalities

We plan to continuously enhance Hurbe with new functionalities and improvements that keeps it on track and aligns with our main goals. Some of the upcoming features include:

**Revenue Transfer via NFT:** This feature will allow creators to transfer a percentage of the revenue from an uploaded video to another user as an NFT. We believe this capability will enable creators to achieve some actions like gifting video revenue, delegating revenue streams for charitable purposes, using as collateral on DeFi platforms or putting up an auction for video revenue NFTs on a marketplace like SentX and so on. Here is a UI Prototype demonstrating this feature.

**DApp Interface Optimization and Application for Mobile:** We plan to build a web user interface and application for Mobile Devices to allow users to create and consume their favorite content on the go with ease, enhancing accessibility and user experience across devices.

**Social Engagement Gamification:** This would entitle both content consumers and creators the ability to earn tokenized points within the DApp, based on the proportion of social engagement activities they contribute to the platform. This mechanism is aimed to boost user interaction, enhance the effectiveness of current engagement strategies, and introduce an additional reward structure, giving users even more value for their time spent on Hurbe.

Hedera Name Service HNS Integration and much more.

These are some of the few major post-hackathon objectives to reflect our commitment to providing a versatile and user-friendly platform for content creators and their audiences.
